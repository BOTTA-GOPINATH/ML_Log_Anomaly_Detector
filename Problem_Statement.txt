Problem Statement:
  Detect abnormal activities in the system/server logs using machine learning.

---

Instead of manually checking logs, We automatially analyze logs and detect unusual patterns, suspicious logs.
this helps to reduce our manual efforts

---
Target Users:

SOC Analysts,
Security Engineers,
DevOps Teams,
Cloud Monitoring Teams.

---
Log type:

Web server logs (Apache/Nginx)

System logs (Linux auth logs)

Windows Event logs


---
Anamoly detection:
There are 3 types of anomalies:

1. Point Anomaly

Single log entry abnormal
Example: 1 IP making 500 requests in 1 minute

2. Contextual Anomaly

Normal behavior but abnormal at specific time
Example: Admin login at 3AM

3. Collective Anomaly

Group of logs together abnormal
Example: Brute force attempts

We detect these anomality behaviour in the logs.
